# undefined-error

Was using this package as a way of running humanloop SDK test and starting a
simple server to reproduce a 4xx/5xx error code.

To do this, I simply updated package dependencies in
v4-alpha/typescript/package.json to point to the local
konfig-axios-fetch-adapter and debugged `yarn test`

I was not able to find the error mentioned here:
